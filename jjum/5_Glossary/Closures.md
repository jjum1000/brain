# Closures

A closure is a function that has access to variables in its outer (enclosing) function's scope, even after the outer function has returned.

## How Closures Work

Closures are created when a function is defined inside another function, allowing the inner function to access the outer function's variables.

## Use Cases

- Data encapsulation
- Private variables
- Module patterns
- Event handlers
