# Understanding [[React]] Hooks

React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8.

## Common Hooks

### useState
Manages component state in functional components.

### useEffect
Handles side effects like data fetching and subscriptions.

### useContext
Accesses context values without prop drilling.

### useCallback
Memoizes callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

Hooks make it easier to reuse stateful logic between components without changing component hierarchy.
